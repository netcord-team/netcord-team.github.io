<h1>Netcord</h1>
<h3>A versatile IRC bot for Discord.</h3>
<h4>warning: may not be stable and is constantly being worked on, so proceed with caution!</h4>
<br>
<h3>Info:</h3>
<p>Netcord is a Discord bot for seamless 24/7 cross-server chatting. Think of it as a userphone that runs 24/7. We will also add chatting between multiple platfroms later on.
<br>
Note: The bot is currently in a WIP state.</p>
